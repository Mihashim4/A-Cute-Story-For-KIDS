<h1>The Goat and the Fox</h1>
  
  
<p><b>There lived two goats named Jiku and Biku. They were great friends.
<br>Even the foxes were scared of these robust goats.</br></b></p>

<p><b>"I can never kill them in a direct attack. Let me find some trick to make them hate each other," 
<br>the fox thought</br></b></p>

<p><b>On one of those days, the fox saw Biku grazing alone.
<br>He quickly approached the goat.</br></b></p>

<p><b>"Your friend Jiku told me that you are very quarrelsome and you ate a lot.
<br>He also said that he doesn't like you at all," the fox said.</br></b></p>

<p><b>'Did Jiku say so?" Biku asked. "Yes. He also said that if he ever sees you again, he will kill you,"
<br>the fox added</br></p></b>

<p><b>Precisely at that time, Jiku goat came there."Friend, I was worried when I didn't see you," 
<br>Jiku said</br>

<p><b>Biku realized that the fox was trying to break their friendship.
<br>He hit the fox with his horns and the scared fox ran away.</br></b></p>
