<h1>The Leopard And The Fox</h1>


<p><b>One day the leopard and the fox were chatting by the riverside.
<br>The leopard looked at his reflection in the river and said,</br>
<br>"My! What a charming,silky coat I have on me! And look at he spots on them</br>
<br>As for you, you look dull and grey!"</b></p>

<p><b>The fox was quite nice to look at. He had a bushy, long tail and 
<br>long pointy ears.But he could never look as handsome as the leopard.</br></b></p>

<p><b>"You may have a nice coat and look smart.I know I do not look as handsome
<br>as you, but I am smart in my head. Real smartness lies in not arguing with </br>
<br>foolish creatures. I do not wish to waste my time quarrelling about looks,"</br>
<br>said the fox as he walked away.</br></b></p>
