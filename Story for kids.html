A Cute Little Moral <b>Story For Kids</b>
</body>
<h1>The Hungry Mouse</h1>
  
  
  
<p><b>Once upon a time there lived a mouse named strings.Strings
had a very thought of time. She had no food for many days and 
made strenuous efforts to get her food. All her efforts went in
vain. She looked everywhere to find her food. As days passed by, 
she became very thin.</b></p>

<p><b>One day, the mouse found a basket with corns. She also noticed a
tiny hole in the basket, which was sufficient enough to move her in.
She easily moved inside the hole. Since she had no foods for many
days, she ate a large amount of corn. Without realizing her, she
continuously ate more and more corns. She realised very later that
she ate a lot more than she actually required. After eating a whole 
lot a corn, she became very fat!</b></p>

<p><b>Satisfied with corns, the fat mouse tried to come out of the basket
through the small hole. Unfortunately, the tiny hole could noticed
accommodate the big mouse!!!! The mouse started screaming 'Oh
god! Let me come out of this basket, how can I come out?'</b></p>

<p><b>A rat after hearing mouse's screaming voice from the basket,
asked her what happened! Mouse tild the story and asked rat a 
solution. Rat told, 'If you want to come out of the basket, wait for
some time or even days to lose all your fat until you grow thin.'</b></p>

<p><b>Mouse started to starve now but with lots of food to come out of this
trap!</p></b>
