<h1>The Tortoise and The Frog</h1>


<p><b>A tortoise and a frog live in a pond
<br>They always quarrelled.</br></b></p>

<p><b><q>Brother tortoise, you are at all good-looking.
<br>You have a body like a rock and an ungly neck and face</q></br>
<br>The frog said</br></b></p>

<p><b>The tortoise smiled when he heard this.</b></p>

<p><b><q>You are also ugly with a pair of bulbous eyes.
<br>Your body is covered with marks and you have such ugly legs,</q></br>
<br>The tortoise retorted.</b></p>

<p><b>Thus a fight broke out between them.
<br>A fish was watching all this.</br>
<br>So the tortoise and the frog went to the fish.</br></p></b>

<p><b><q>Brother fish, can you please say who among us is handsome?</q>
<br>they asked.</br></b></p>

<p><i><b><u><q>Neither of you is good-looking. Don't you both speak more about
<br>the faults of others than about their qualities? Good words and deeds</br>
<br>of a person are his real beauty, not a beautiful physical appearance,</q></br>
<br>the fish said</br></i></b></u></p>

<p><b>They both felt that the fish was right. From then on, they never 
<br>quarrelled again and became very good friends.
