</body>
<h1>The Greed Of The Lion</h1>
  
  
  
<p><b>Once, there was a lion.<br> One day, while
looking for food, he saw a rabbit.</br> <br> "Wow, this
made my day", the lion thought.</br> He chased the
rabbit and in one leap captured it.</b></p>

<p><b>It was then he noticed a healthy deer.<br>
"A deer is better than a rabbit!" he thought.</br>
<br>The lion discarded the rabbit and went after 
the deer.</br> But the deer could run very fast.</b></p>

<p><b>The lion could not catch the deer.<br>
Thus he lost the rabbit he had and failed
to get the deer.</br></b></p>

<p><b>The disappointed lion sadly went back to the forest</p></b>
